## Motivation

I wanted to break away from the standard, often dull look of todo apps and build something thatâ€™s actually fun to use. Inspired by the nostalgic design of Super Mario, I aimed to combine productivity with a playful interfaceâ€”making completing tasks feel more like winning a level than checking a box.

## How To Use

Currently, GitHub is the only sign-in option.

1. Log in with your GitHub account.
2. The rest (hopefully) is self-explanatory!

**Note**: MarioTodo might look very awful on smaller or very large screens. Currently working on that.

## What I Learned

- How visual design and gamification can impact user motivation  
- Creating playful UI interactions while maintaining accessibility  
- Structuring a frontend for smooth, responsive animations and transitions  
- Managing user sessions and data flow for a seamless experience  

## Upcoming / missing features:
- Look good on all display sizes
- Re-arrange tasks with drag and drop
- Show completed tasks and be able to put them back to the list 
- Sound effects and animations for extra feedback
