## What I Learned

- Nintendo will sue anyone older than 2 years old using their IP.

## How To Use

Currently, GitHub is the only sign-in option.

1. Log in with your GitHub account.
2. The rest (hopefully) is self-explanatory.

**Note**: MarioTodo might look very awful on smaller or very large screens. Currently working on that.

## Upcoming / missing features:
- Look good on all display sizes
- Re-arrange tasks with drag and drop
- Show completed tasks and be able to put them back to the list 
- Sound effects and animations for extra feedback
